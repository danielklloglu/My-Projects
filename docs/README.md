_Mechanical engineer and design enthusiast based in Chicago and Istanbul 🇹🇷🇺🇸_ <br>

[Email](mailto:danielklloglu@gmail.com) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielkillioglu)

I am a second-year student pursuing an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering degree at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. I aim to combine my user-centered design and engineering knowledge to find practical and creative solutions with an aesthetic twist.

I take a special interest in the future of cars, space exploration, and design. I always appreciate connecting with individuals who share my passion for design, tech, and vehicles. I am currently looking for internship opportunities that would help me cultivate and further hone skills in Automotive/Mechanical Engineering and challenge me intellectually.
