Hello! I am a third-year student pursuing an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering degree at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. I aim to combine my user-centered design and engineering knowledge to find practical and creative solutions with an aesthetic twist.

I take a special interest in the future of cars, music technology, and design. I always appreciate connecting with individuals who share my passion for design, tech, and vehicles. I am currently looking for internship opportunities that would help me cultivate and further hone skills in Automotive/Mechanical Engineering and challenge me intellectually. <br>
